## Introduction

This is the web page of the course
*Data Structures and Algorithms for Computational Lingustics III, WS 2023-2024*
taught at the
[Department of Computational Linguistics](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/134536),
[University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/).

This programming course provides an introduction to algorithms and data
structures that are commonly used in computational linguistics, such as
string distance measures, data structures for approximate string search,
and finite state automata and related algorithms. The course is driven by
assignments where participants implement these algorithms and data
structures in small, but practical, applications.

Please see the [course syllabus](dsacl3-syllabus.pdf) for more
information about course policies.

### Goals

By the end of the course you will be able to:

  * Become (more) familiar with important data structures and
    algorithms.
  * Write programs to query directed and undirected graphs, such as:
    - Are two vertices connected?
    - What is the shortest path between two vertices?
    - Does a directed graph contain cycles?
  * Implement a spell-checker.
  * Implement a recognizer for finite state grammars.

### GitHub registration

We will make use of git through GitHub classroom.
Please obtain a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
before the beginning of the course.
